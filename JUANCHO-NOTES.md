## Notes on the project
Overall you delivered on the project brief.  The finished project has a level of polish that I was, quite honestly, not expecting.


My overall assessment of the project is that this project deserves an A.  I am awarding 25 points for the executable.  The documentation does also cover the brief of the project.  I am awarding 5 points for the documentation.

It is a demo that was put together while you were learning to work as a team and thus I did not expect the project to be perfect.  The notes here are for you to consider as takeaways from a customer experience of using your product.

* I like that the whole application is on one page.  The document manager stands out and is collapsible. 
* The list of Documents as a drop down.  This is the only non-intuitive part.  It took me a while to find that

* 

* The look of the edit sheet is great.  I like the layout and the clean look
* Why did you choose del instead of c for the remove token?  The calculator has c
